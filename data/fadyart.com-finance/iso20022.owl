An executing party, eg, a transfer agent, sends the SubscriptionOrderConfirmation message to the instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative to confirm the details of the execution of a SubscriptionOrder instruction. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The SubscriptionOrderConfirmation message is used to confirm the execution of one or more individual orders. A SubscriptionOrder message containing more than one individual order may be responded to by more than one SubscriptionOrderConfirmation message, as the valuation cycle of the financial instruments in each individual order may be different. Each individual order confirmation specified is identified in DealReference. 
The reference of the original individual order is specified in OrderReference. The message identification of the SubscriptionOrder message in which the individual orders was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference. When the executing party sends several confirmations, there is no specific indication in the message that it is an incomplete confirmation. Reconciliation must be based on the references. A SubscriptionOrder must in all cases be responded to by a SubscriptionOrderConfirmation message and in no circumstances by a SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmation message. If the executing party needs to confirm a SubscriptionBulkOrder message, then a SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmation message must be used.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scope&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
An instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, sends the RedemptionOrder message to the executing party, eg, a transfer agent, to instruct the redemption of one or more financial instruments for one investment fund account. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The RedemptionOrder message is used to instruct single redemption orders, ie, a message containing one order for one financial instrument and related to one investment account. The RedemptionOrder message may also be used for multiple orders, ie, a message containing several orders related to the same investment account for different financial instruments. For a single redemption order, the RedemptionOrder message, not the RedemptionBulkOrder message, must be used. If there are redemption orders for the same financial instrument but for different accounts, then the RedemptionBulkOrder message must be used. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Main characteristics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The RedemptionOrder message has the following main characteristics: 
&lt;b&gt;Multiple Order Details&lt;/b&gt; 
An order is composed of one or several individual orders. These individual orders have common characteristics such as the same investment account, the same cancellation right and the same place of trade. However, each individual order may specify a different financial instrument, quantity of financial instruments, commission levels, etc. 
&lt;b&gt;Redemption in GrossAmount or NetAmount or UnitsNumber or HoldingsRedemptionRate&lt;/b&gt; 
The redemption quantity must be expressed in one of the following ways: 
- GrossAmount: the monetary GROSS value of the financial instrument to be redeemed to, eg, the redemption of EUR 1,500 of financial instrument ISIN LU0123456789, or 
- NetAmount: the monetary NET value of the financial instrument to be redeemed to, eg, the redemption of EUR 1,000 of financial instrument ISIN LU0123456789, or 
- UnitNumber: the number of units of financial instrument to be redeemed to, eg, the redemption of 10 units of financial instrument ISIN LU0123456789. 
- HoldingsRedemptionRate: the part of the portfolio to be redeemed, eg, the redemption of 10% of the holdings in financial instrument ISIN LU1234567890. 
&lt;b&gt;Cash Settlement&lt;/b&gt; 
The cash settlement of a multiple order may be specified either as a single bulk payment, or as individual settlements for each order. Since the valuation and settlement cycle of all the investment funds in the multiple order may be different, there is no guarantee that a single bulk cash settlement can take place for all of the individual orders inside the multiple order. When a bulk cash settlement is not possible, specific cash settlement details may be included for each individual order inside a multiple order. If no standing instruction has been set up at the account level, then cash settlement information must be present in the message. If there is a standing instruction, but cash settlement information is also present in the message, then the cash settlement information in the message overrides the standing instruction.
&lt;b&gt;Charge and Commission&lt;/b&gt; 
Generally speaking, a charge is directly paid by the investor whereas a commission is paid by the fund to the intermediary. This rule might not apply to some specific markets.</rdfs:comment>

An executing party, eg, a transfer agent, sends the TransferOutConfirmation message to the instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, to confirm the delivery of a financial instrument, free of payment, on a given date, to a specified party. This message may also be used to confirm the delivery of a financial instrument, free of payment, to another of the instructing parties own accounts or to a third party. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The TransferOutConfirmation message is used to confirm the withdrawal of a financial instrument from the owner's account and its delivery to another own account, or to a third party, has taken place. The reference of the transfer confirmation is identified in TransferConfirmationReference. 
The reference of the original transfer instruction is specified in TransferReference. 
The message identification of the TransferOutInstruction message in which the transfer instruction was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Main characteristics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The TransferOutConfirmation message has the following characteristics: 
&lt;u&gt;Physical or Non-physical transfers&lt;/u&gt; 
The message confirms either a physical transfer or a non-physical transfer. The type of transfer must be indicated using the PhysicalTransferIndicator. 
&lt;u&gt;Own account or third party transfers&lt;/u&gt;
The message confirms either a transfer of securities between two accounts owned by the same instructing party, or a transfer to a third party. 
The type of transfer may be indicated using OwnAccountTransferIndicator.</rdfs:comment>

A report provider, eg, a transfer agent, fund accountant or market data provider, sends the PriceReportCancellation message to the report recipient, eg, a fund management company, transfer agent, market data provider, regulator or any other interested party to cancel a previously sent PriceReport message. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The PriceReportCancellation is used to cancel an entire PriceReport message that was previously sent. If only a part of the information needs to be cancelled and replaced, the PriceReportCorrection message must be used. 
This message must contain the reference of the message to be cancelled.This message may also contain details of the message to be cancelled, but this is not recommended.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scope&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
An instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, sends the RedemptionOrderCancellationRequest message to the executing party, eg, a transfer agent, to request the cancellation of a previously sent RedemptionOrder instruction. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The RedemptionOrderCancellationRequest message is used to either: 
- request the cancellation of an entire RedemptionOrder message, ie, all the individual orders that it contained, or, 
- request the cancellation of one or more individual orders. There is no amendment, but a cancellation and re-instruct policy. 
There are two ways to use the message: 
(1) When the RedemptionOrderCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of an entire RedemptionOrder message, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the order references of all the individual orders listed in the RedemptionOrder message, or, 
- quoting the details of all the individual orders (this includes the OrderReference) listed in RedemptionOrder message, but this is not recommended. 
The message identification of the RedemptionOrder message may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to request the cancellation of an entire RedemptionOrder message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference, but this is not recommended.
(2) When the RedemptionOrderCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of one or more individual orders, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the OrderReference of each individual order listed in the RedemptionOrder message, or,
- quoting the details of each individual order (including the OrderReference) listed in RedemptionOrder message, but this is not recommended. 
The message identification of the RedemptionOrder message in which the individual order was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. The deadline and acceptance of a cancellation request is subject to a service level agreement (SLA). 
This cancellation message is a cancellation request. There is no automatic acceptance of the cancellation. The rejection or acceptance of a RedemptionOrderCancellationRequest is made using an OrderCancellationStatusReport message.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
An executing party, eg, a transfer agent, sends the OrderCancellationStatusReport to the instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, to report the status of an order cancellation request that was previously received. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The OrderCancellationStatusReport message is used to provide the status of: 
- one or more individual order cancellation requests by using IndividualCancellationStatusReport, or, 
- an order cancellation request message by using CancellationStatusReport. 
If the OrderCancellationStatusReport message is used to report the status of an individual order cancellation request, then the repetitive IndividualCancellationStatusReport sequence is used and the order reference of the individual order is quoted in OrderReference. The messageidentification of the message in which the individual order was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference. 
If the OrderCancellationStatusReport message is used to report the status of an entire order cancellation request message, for example, the SubscriptionBulkOrderCancellationRequest, or a SubscriptionOrderCancellationRequest containing several orders, then the CancellationStatusReport sequence. is used and the message identification of the order cancellation request message is quoted in RelatedReference. 
All the order cancellation requests within the message must have the same status. One of the following statuses can be reported: 
- the order cancellation is pending, or, 
- the order cancellation request is rejected, or, 
- the order is cancelled. 
When the cancellation is rejected, the reason for the rejection must be specified. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Main characteristics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The OrderCancellationStatusReport message has the following main characteristics: 
&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt; 
It is mandatory to include the reference of the previously sent message, ie the OrderCancellationInstruction, for which the Sender is requesting a status. Status must be either specified in the CancellationStatusReport building block or in the IndividualCancellationStatusReport building block. If it is in the CancellationStatusReport building block, then that building block is mandatory. If it is in the IndividualCancellationStatusReport building block, then that building block is mandatory. 
&lt;b&gt;CancellationStatusReport&lt;/b&gt; 
This building block can be mandatory (see rule above) but is not repetitive. This means that it is not possible to report on more than one cancellation instruction per message. It is mandatory to specify either the status of the order instruction (using Status) or why cancellation is not possible (using Rejected). 
&lt;b&gt;IndividualCancellationStatusReport&lt;/b&gt; 
This building block can be mandatory (see rule above) and is repetitive. This means that it is possible to report on more than one cancellation instruction per message. It is mandatory to specify either the status of the order instruction (using Status) or why cancellation is not possible (using Rejected).</rdfs:comment>

An instructing party, eg, a transfer agent, sends the TransferInCancellationRequest message to the executing party, eg, a transfer agent, to request the cancellation of a previously sent TransferInInstruction. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The TransferInCancellationRequest message is used to request cancellation of a previously sent TransferInInstruction. There are two ways to specify the transfer cancellation request. Either:
 - the transfer reference of the original transfer is quoted, or,
 - all the details of the original transfer (this includes TransferReference) are quoted but this is not recommended. 
The message identification of the TransferInInstruction message in which the transfer was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. 
It is also possible to request the cancellation of a TransferInInstruction message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference.</rdfs:comment>

An account owner, eg, an investor or its designated agent sends the AccountOpeningInstruction message to an account servicer, eg, a registrar, transfer agent or custodian to instruct the opening of an account or the opening of an account and establishing an investment plan.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The AccountOpeningInstruction is used to open an account directly or indirectly with the account servicer or an intermediary.
In some markets, eg, Australia, and for some products in the United Kingdom, a first order (also known as a deposit instruction) is placed at the same time as the account opening. To cater for this scenario, an order message can be linked (via references in the message) to the AccountOpeningInstruction message when needed.
Execution of the AccountOpeningInstruction is confirmed via an AccountDetailsConfirmation message.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Scope &lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
An instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, sends the SubscriptionOrderCancellationRequest message to the executing party, eg, a transfer agent, to request the cancellation of a previously sent SubscriptionOrder. 
&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Usage &lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
The SubscriptionOrderCancellationRequest message is used to either: 
- request the cancellation of an entire SubscriptionOrder message, ie, all the individual orders that it contained, or, 
- request the cancellation of one or more individual orders. There is no amendment, but a cancellation and re-instruct policy. 
There are two ways to use the message: 
(1) When the SubscriptionOrderCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of an entire SubscriptionOrder message, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the order references of all the individual orders listed in the SubscriptionOrder message, or, 
- quoting the details of all the individual orders (this includes the OrderReference) listed in SubscriptionOrder message, but this is not recommended. The message identification of the SubscriptionOrder message may also be quoted in PreviousReference. 
It is also possible to request the cancellation of an entire SubscriptionOrder message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference, but this is not recommended. 
(2) When the SubscriptionOrderCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of one or more individual orders, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the OrderReference of each individual order listed in the SubscriptionOrder message, or,
- quoting the details of each individual order (including the OrderReference) listed in SubscriptionOrder message, but this is not recommended. The message identification of the SubscriptionOrder message in which the individual order was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. 
The deadline and acceptance of a cancellation request is subject to a service level agreement (SLA). This cancellation message is a cancellation request. There is no automatic acceptance of the cancellation. 
The rejection or acceptance of a SubscriptionOrderCancellationRequest is made using an OrderCancellationStatusReport message.</rdfs:comment>

An executing party, eg, a transfer agent sends the SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmationAmendment message to the instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative to amend a previously sent SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmation message. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmationAmendment message is used to amend one or more previously sent subscription bulk order confirmations. Each bulk order confirmation amendment specified is identified in DealReference. 
The reference of the original individual order is specified in OrderReference. 
The message identification of the SubscriptionBulkOrder message in which the orders were conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference.

An account servicer, eg, a transfer agent, sends the AccountingStatementofHoldingsCancellation message to an account owner, eg, a fund manager or an account owner's designated agent, to notify the cancellation of a previously sent AccountingStatementOfHoldings message. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The AccountingStatementOfHoldingsCancellation message is used to cancel a previously sent AccountingStatementOfHoldings message. This message must contain the reference of the message to be cancelled. 
This message may also contain all the details of the message to be cancelled, but this is not recommended.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#RedemptionProcessBulkOrder"/>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scope&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
An executing party, eg, a transfer agent, sends the RedemptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message to the instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative to cancel a previously sent RedemptionOrderConfirmation message. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The RedemptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to cancel one or more previously sent redemption order confirmations. The amendment indicator element is used to specify whether the redemption order confirmation cancellation is to be followed by a RedemptionOrderConfirmationAmendment. 
The RedemptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to either: 
- cancel an entire RedemptionOrderConfirmation message, ie, all the individual order confirmations that it contained, or, 
- request the cancellation of one or more individual confirmations. 
There are two ways to use the message. 
(1) When the RedemptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to cancel an entire message, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the business references, eg, OrderReference, Deal Reference, of all the individual order confirmations listed in the RedemptionOrderConfirmation message, or, 
- quoting the details of all the individual order confirmations (this includes the OrderReference and DealReference) listed in RedemptionOrderConfirmation message but this is not recommended. The message identification of the RedemptionOrderConfirmation message may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to instruct the cancellation of an entire confirmation message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference, but this is not recommended. 
(2) When the RedemptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to cancel one or more individual order confirmations, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the business references, eg, OrderReference, Deal Reference, of each individual order confirmation listed in the RedemptionOrderConfirmation message, or, 
- quoting the details of each individual order execution (this includes the OrderReference and DealReference) listed in RedemptionOrderConfirmation message but this is not recommended. 
The message identification of the RedemptionOrderConfirmation message in which the individual order confirmation was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. The rejection or acceptance of a RedemptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction is made using an OrderConfirmationStatusReport message.</rdfs:comment>

An account servicer, eg, a registrar, transfer agent or custodian bank sends the AccountManagementStatusReport message to an account owner or its designated agent, eg, an investor to report on the receipt or the processing status of a previously received AccountOpeningInstruction or AccountModificationInstruction or GetAccountDetails message. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The AccountManagementStatusReport message is used to provide the processing status of a previously received AccountOpeningInstruction or of an AccountModificationInstruction message. The AccountManagementStatusReport message is also used by an account servicer to reject an AccountOpeningInstruction or AccountModificationInstruction or GetAccountDetails message when the message is not compliant with the agreed SLA or when the account cannot be uniquely identified. 
The account owner may report that the status of the instruction is either rejected, accepted, that the instruction is being processed or that the instruction has been forwarded to the next intermediary party for further processing.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
An executing party, eg, a (old) plan manager, sends the PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferConfirmation message to the instructing party, eg, a (new) plan manager, to confirm the transfer of one or more PEP or ISA or portfolio products from the client's account at the old plan manager to the client's account at the new plan manager through a nominee account. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferConfirmation message is used to confirm the transfer of one or more PEP or ISA or portfolio products. 
The reference of each product transfer confirmation is identified in TransferConfirmationIdentification. 
The reference of the original product transfer is specified in TransferInstructionReference. 
The message identification of the PEPOrISAPOrPortfolioTransferInstruction message in which the product transfers were conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference. &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Main characteristics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The following are the main characteristics of the PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferConfirmation message: 
&lt;b&gt;Single client/multiple transfer instructions&lt;/b&gt; 
Each PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferConfirmation message specifies one or more transfers for one client. Each transfer is for delivery to the cash same account. 
&lt;b&gt;Quantity of the product&lt;/b&gt; 
In order to cater for full and partial transfers of holdings, this message allows the quantity to be specified in three mutually exclusive ways. 
1. Percentage transfer: A quantity of a financial instrument (PEP or ISA) may be expressed as percentage of the investor's total holding. 
2. Amount transfer: A quantity of a financial instrument (PEP or ISA) may be expressed as an amount of money. 
3. Year transfer: A quantity of a financial instrument (PEP or ISA) may be identified by the year in which the PEP or ISA was created. Additionally the PEP or ISA may be made up of one or more assets. When the assets are specified they must be identified by an ISIN or a SEDOL and optionally by name. 
&lt;b&gt;Identification of the client&lt;/b&gt; 
The client is identified by its account number with the old plan manager, its name and address. Additional client identification information such as date of birth and social security number must also be included.</rdfs:comment>

A report provider, eg, a transfer agent, fund accountant or market data provider, sends the PriceReportCorrection message to the report recipient, eg, a fund management company, transfer agent, market data provider, regulator or any other interested party to correct at least one of the prices for a financial instrument that was reported in a previously sent PriceReport message. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The PriceReportCorrection message is used to correct information reported in a previously sent PriceReport. If an entire PriceReport message must be corrected, eg, due to an incorrect trade date, it is recommended that a PriceReportCancellation message is used to cancel the entire PriceReport message and a new PriceReport sent.</rdfs:comment>

from one account to another own account or to a third party account.
These message definitions can be grouped into two categories:
- Transfer out,
- Transfer in.
Specific message definitions have been created for transfer out and transfer in. As processing of transfers is different for
many institutions, there is a need to differentiate at message type level.
For each category, four main flows are covered:
- the transfer instruction,
- the transfer cancellation request,
- the transfer confirmation,
- the reversal of the transfer confirmation.</rdfs:comment>

A report provider, eg, a transfer agent, sends the FundConfirmedCashForecastReport message to the report user, eg, an investment manager, to report the confirmed cash incomings and outgoings of one or more investment funds on one or more trade dates. 
The cash movements may result from, for example, redemption, subscription, switch transactions or reinvestment of dividends. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The FundConfirmedCashForecastReport is used to report definitive cash movements, ie, it is sent after the cutoff time and/or the price valuation of the fund. This message contains incoming and outgoing cash flows that are confirmed, ie, the price has been applied. If the price is not yet definitive, then the FundEstimatedCashForecastReport message must be used. 
This message allows the report provider to report cash movements in or out of a fund, but does not allow the Sender to categorise these movements, for example by country, or to give details of the underlying orders, commission or charges. 
If the report provider wishes to give detailed information related to cash movements, then the FundDetailedConfirmedCashForecastReport message must be used.</rdfs:comment>

A report provider, eg, a transfer agent, sends the FundDetailedEstimatedCashForecastReport message to the report user, eg, an investment manager, to report the estimated cash incomings and outgoings, sorted by country, institution name or other criteria defined by the user of one or more investment funds on one or more trade dates. The cash movements may result from, for example, redemption, subscription, switch transactions or reinvestment of dividends. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The FundDetailedEstimatedCashForecastReport is used to provide estimated cash movements, ie, it is sent prior to the cut-off time and/or the price valuation of the fund. If the price is definitive, then the FundDetailedConfirmedCashForecastReport message must be used. 
The FundDetailedEstimatedCashForecastReport message is used to report cash movements in or out of a fund, organised by party, eg, fund management company, country, currency or by some other criteria defined by the report provider. 
If the report is used to give the cash-in and cash-out for a party, then additional criteria, eg, currency and country, can be specified. In addition, the underlying transaction type for the cash-in or cash-out movement can be specified, as well as information about the cash movement's underlying orders, eg, commission and charges.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scope&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
An executing party, eg, a transfer agent, sends the RedemptionOrderConfirmation message to the instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative to confirm the details of execution for a previously received RedemptionOrder message. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The RedemptionOrderConfirmation message is used to confirm the execution of one or more individual orders. A RedemptionOrder message containing more than one individual order may be responded to by more than one RedemptionOrderConfirmation message, as the valuation cycle of the financial instruments in each individual order may be different. Each individual order confirmation specified is identified in DealReference. The reference of the original individual order is specified in OrderReference. The message identification of the RedemptionOrder message in which the individual order was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference. When the executing party sends several confirmations, there is no specific indication in the message that it is an incomplete confirmation. Reconciliation should be based on the references. A RedemptionOrder must in all cases be responded to by a RedemptionOrderConfirmation message and in no circumstances by a RedemptionBulkOrderConfirmation message. If the executing party needs to confirm a RedemptionBulkOrder message, then a edemptionBulkOrderConfirmation message must be used.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Order messages are used to instruct the executing party to subscribe, to redeem or to switch a given amount/quantity of a specified financial instrument. 
As the processes are different for many institutions, there is a need to differentiate at message type level. These message definitions can be grouped into three categories: 
- Subscription, 
- Redemption, 
- Switch. 

Orders in the funds industry may be given according to different scenarios, 
    eg, some players group orders before sending them to the next party in the chain. In order to cater for this, two sub-categories have been created for the subscription and the redemption types of message definitions.
 - Bulk order: A bulk message is typically a message containing a series of individual order transactions from different accounts, but for the same financial instrument with the same intermediary details. The order will result in a single cash settlement (not settlement per individual order) executed using one single method. This order is sent by a concentrator or a party collecting orders and bulking them to relay the transactions to the transfer agent or another intermediary. 
- Order: An order message is typically a message containing a single order or multiple orders (list of orders related to several financial instruments) for the same account. It is a 'shopping list' for one account. This type of order is typically sent by financial advisers or banks that are managing a portfolio for a particular account. 
In short, a bulk is "1 financial instrument-n accounts"; and an order is "1 account-1 financial instrument"; if it is a single order and "1 account-n financial instruments"; if it is a multiple order. 
No specific order category has been created for cross or 'bed and breakfast' orders. In some countries, for legal reasons, these must appear as separate orders, while in others, the two orders may be given together. Therefore, no specific order has been created for a bed and breakfast order, as this transaction is the combination of a redemption and a subscription linked together. 
Limit and forward orders are not covered, as these are not common in the Funds industry. 
For each category, below main flows are covered: 
- the order, 
- the order confirmation, 
- the order cancellation instruction. 
There is no order amendment message definition, as the agreed philosophy is 'cancel and replace'. In addition, message definitions for 2 new flows are now available. They are: 
- the order confirmation amendment, 
- the order confirmation cancellation. 
These message definitions cover the cases where one or several details in the order confirmation message need to be amended or when the entire order confirmation message needs to be cancelled.</rdfs:comment>

date or period.
These message definitions can be grouped into three categories:
- Accounting holdings statement,
- Custody holdings statement,
- Transactions statement.
For each category, two main flows are covered:
- the statement
- the statement cancellation
Additional message definitions, eg, request for statement message or statement of pending transactions will be available
in the next phases of the standards initiative.</rdfs:comment>

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The RedemptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to cancel one or more previously sent redemption order confirmations. The amendment indicator element is used to specify whether the redemption order confirmation cancellation is to be followed by a RedemptionOrderConfirmationAmendment. 
The RedemptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to either: - cancel an entire RedemptionOrderConfirmation message, ie, all the individual order confirmations that it contained, or, 
- request the cancellation of one or more individual confirmations. There are two ways to use the message. 
(1) When the RedemptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to cancel an entire message, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the business references, eg, OrderReference, Deal Reference, of all the individual order confirmations listed in the RedemptionOrderConfirmation message, or, 
- quoting the details of all the individual order confirmations (this includes the OrderReference and DealReference) listed in RedemptionOrderConfirmation message but this is not recommended. 
The message identification of the RedemptionOrderConfirmation message may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to instruct the cancellation of an entire confirmation message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference, but this is not recommended. 
(2) When the RedemptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to cancel one or more individual order confirmations, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the business references, eg, OrderReference, Deal Reference, of each individual order confirmation listed in the RedemptionOrderConfirmation message, or, 
- quoting the details of each individual order execution (this includes the OrderReference and DealReference) listed in RedemptionOrderConfirmation message but this is not recommended. 
The message identification of the RedemptionOrderConfirmation message in which the individual order confirmation was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. The rejection or acceptance of a RedemptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction is made using an OrderConfirmationStatusReport message.</rdfs:comment>

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The TransferCancellationStatusReport message is used to report on the status of a transfer in or transfer out cancellation request. The reference of the transfer instruction for which the cancellation status is reported is identified in TransferReference. 
The message identification of the transfer cancellation request message in which the transfer instruction was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference. The message identification of the transfer instruction request message in which the transfer instruction was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference. 
One of the following statuses can be reported:
 - the transfer cancellation is accepted, or,
 - the transfer cancellation has been sent to the next party, or,
 - the transfer cancellation is complete and the reason for the status,
 - the transfer cancellation pending and the reason for the status,

(1) When the SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to cancel an entire message, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the business references, eg, OrderReference, Deal Reference, of all the individual order confirmations listed in the SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmation message, or, 
- quoting the details of all the individual order confirmations (this includes the OrderReference and DealReference) listed in SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmation message but this is not recommended. 
The message identification of the SubscriptionOrderConfirmation message may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to instruct the cancellation of an entire confirmation message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference, but this is not recommended. 
(2) When the SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to cancel one or more individual order confirmations, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the business references, eg, OrderReference, Deal Reference, of each individual order confirmation listed in the SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmation message, or, - quoting the details of each individual order execution (this includes the OrderReference and DealReference) listed in SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmation message but this is not recommended. The message identification of the SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmation message in which the individual order confirmation was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. 
The rejection or acceptance of a SubscriptionBulkOrderCancellationInstruction is made using an OrderConfirmationStatusReport message.</rdfs:comment>

The order will result in a single cash settlement (not settlement per individual order) executed using one single method. This order is sent by a concentrator or a party collecting orders and bulking them to relay the transactions to the transfer agent or another intermediary.</rdfs:comment>

An instructing party, eg, a (new) plan manager, sends the PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferCancellationRequest message to the executing party, eg, a (old) plan manager, to request the cancellation of a previously sent PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of an entire PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction message, ie, all the product transfers that it contained. 
The cancellation request can be specified either by: 
- quoting the transfer references of all the product transfers listed in the PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction message, or, 
- quoting the details of all the product transfers (this includes TransferReference) listed in PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction message. 
The message identification of the PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to request the cancellation of PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction by just quoting its message identification in PreviousReference. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Main characteristics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferCancellationRequest message has the following main characteristics: 
&lt;b&gt;One request per message&lt;/b&gt; 
Each PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferCancellationRequest message specifies only one previously sent message to be cancelled. 
&lt;b&gt;Identification of the cancelled instruction&lt;/b&gt; 
The identification of the message for which a cancellation is requested is specified in the PreviousReference field. The TransferToBeCancelled element contains a copy of the instruction.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scope &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
An account servicer, eg, a registrar, transfer agent or custodian bank, sends the SecuritiesMessageRejection message to an account owner, eg, an investor or its authorised agent, to reject a previously received message on which action cannot be taken. The message may also be sent by the executing party, eg, transfer agent to the instructing party, eg, investment manager or its authorised representative to reject a previously received message on which action cannot be taken. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The SecuritiesMessageRejection message is used for the following reasons:
 - the executing party does not recognise the linked reference, so the executing party cannot process the message
 - the instructing party should not have sent the message. Reasons that a receiver does not expect a message include no SLA in place between the Sender and the Receiver. The SecuritiesMessageRejection message must not be used to reject an instruction message that cannot be processed for business reasons, eg, if information is missing in an instruction message or because securities are not available for settlement.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
An instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, sends the RequestForOrderStatusReport to the executing party, eg, a transfer agent, to request the status of one or more order instruction or order cancellation request messages. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The RequestForOrderStatusReport message is used to request the status of: 
- one or several individual order instructions, or, 
- one or several order messages, or 
- one or several individual order cancellation requests, or, 
- one or several order cancellation request messages. 
The response to a RequestForOrderStatusReport message is the OrderInstructionStatusReport message or OrderCancellationStatusReport message. 
If the RequestForOrderStatusReport message is used to request the status of several individual order instructions or one or more order instruction messages, then the instructing party may receive several OrderInstructionStatusReport messages from the executing party. 
If the RequestForOrderStatusReport message is used to request the status of several individual order cancellation requests or one or more order cancellation messages, then the instructing party may receive several OrderCancellationStatusReport messages from the executing party. When the RequestForOrderStatusReport is used to request the status of one or more individual orders or order cancellations, each individual order is identified with its order reference. The investment account and/or financial instrument related to the order can also be identified. The message identification of the message in which the individual order was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. When the RequestForOrderStatusReport is used to request the status of an order message or an order cancellations request message, then the message identification of the order or cancellation message is identified in PreviousReference. The RequestForOrderStatusReport message may not be used to request the status of an investment account, a transfer or the status of a financial instrument. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Main characteristics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The RequestForOrderStatusReport has the following characteristics: 
&lt;b&gt;References &lt;/b&gt;
It is mandatory to assign a message reference to the RequestForOrderStatusReport message. It is mandatory to quote the reference(s) of the order or order cancellation messages, for which a status is being requested. 
&lt;b&gt;InvestmentAccountDetails&lt;/b&gt; 
The instructing party may quote account details to identify the account related to the order message for which the status is being requested.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:about="#FundCashForecastReportingMessage">
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The fund cash forecast reporting message definitions are used to provide a report of the cash incomings and outgoings
per investment fund. The cash incomings and outgoings result from redemption, subscription and switch transactions.
These message definitions are grouped into two categories.
- Estimated report: contains estimated cash forecasts, ie, cash flows calculated with an estimated price, usually the
price of the previous trade date.
- Confirmed report: contains confirmed cash forecasts, ie, cash flows calculated with the definitive price on a specific
trade date.
Each category is divided into two sub-categories:
- Short report: contains incoming and outgoing cash flows.
- Detailed report: contains incoming and outgoing cash flows. These may be sorted according to predefined or userdefined
criteria and breakdown information may be given.
Estimated cash forecast messages do not need to be cancelled and replaced, as an estimated message overwrites the
previous estimated message. Confirmed cash forecast reports may be cancelled and for this reason, two cancellation
message definitions exist.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scope &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
A report provider, eg, a transfer agent, fund accountant or market data provider, sends the PriceReport message to the report recipient, eg, a fund management company, transfer agent, market data provider, regulator or other interested party to provide the net asset value and price information for financial instruments on specific trade dates and, optionally, to quote price variation information. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The PriceReport message is used to:
 - report prices for one or several different financial instruments for one or several different trade dates,
 - report statistical information about the valuation of a financial instrument,
 - inform another party that the quotation of a financial instrument is suspended,
 - report prices that are used for purposes other than the execution of investment funds orders. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Main characteristics &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The PriceReport message has the following main characteristics: 
&lt;u&gt;Price Valuation &lt;/u&gt;
This is the process during which the fund accountant calculates the value of assets, including liabilities, expenses, income, buy/sell orders, etc, of the fund and calculates the total net asset value (NAV), the NAV per unit, the dealing and unit price (s). 
The calculation method and accounting principles are given in the fund prospectus. 
&lt;u&gt;Type of Price &lt;/u&gt;
Different types of price can be reported. 
For example, the PriceReport message can contain, for trade date 21 April 2003, the cancellation price, the bid price and the offer price of financial instrument ISIN LU1234567890. 
&lt;u&gt;Number of Financial Instruments Reported &lt;/u&gt;
There is no limitation on the number of financial instruments for which a price can be reported in this message. 
The number of financial instruments allowed in each message is defined in the fund prospectus or in the service level agreement (SLA) in place between the Sender and the Receiver.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
An executing party, eg, a transfer agent, send the RequestForOrderConfirmationStatusReport message to the instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, to request the status of one or several order confirmations. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The RequestForOrderConfirmationStatusReport message is used to request the status of either: 
- one or several individual order confirmations, or, 
- one or several order confirmation messages. The response to a RequestForOrderConfirmationStatusReport message is the OrderConfirmationStatusReport message. 
When the RequestForOrderConfirmationStatusReport message is used to request the status of several individual order confirmations or one or more order confirmation messages, the executing party may receive several OrderConfirmationStatusReport messages from the instructing party. 
When the RequestForOrderConfirmationStatusReport is used to request the status of one or more individual order confirmations, each individual order confirmation is identified with its order reference. The message identification of the message in which the individual order confirmation was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. When the RequestForOrderConfirmationStatusReport is used to request the status of an order confirmation message, then the message identification of the order confirmation message is identified in PreviousReference.</rdfs:comment>

A report provider, eg, a transfer agent, sends the FundDetailedConfirmedCashForecastReport message to the report user, eg, an investment manager, to report the confirmed cash incomings and outgoings, sorted by country, institution name or other criteria defined by the user of one or more investment funds on one or more trade dates. 
The cash movements may result from, for example, redemption, subscription, switch transactions or reinvestment of dividends. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The FundDetailedConfirmedCashForecastReport is used to provide definitive cash movements, ie, it is sent after the cutoff time and/or the price valuation of the fund. If the price is not yet definitive, then the FundDetailedEstimatedCashForecastReport message must be used. The FundDetailedConfirmedCashForecastReport message is used to report cash movements in or out of a fund, organised by party, eg, fund management company, country, currency or by some other criteria defined by the report provider. 
If the report is used to given the cash-in and cash-out for a party, then additional criteria, eg, currency and country, can be specified. In addition, the underlying transaction type for the cash-in or cash-out movement can be specified, as well as information about the cash movement's underlying orders, eg, commission and charges.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scope&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
An account servicer, eg, a transfer agent sends the AccountStatementOfHoldings message to an account owner, eg, a fund manager or an account owner's designated agent to provide detailed holdings of the portfolio at a specified moment in time. 
The message provides, at a moment in time, valuations of the portfolio together with details of each financial instrument holding. The message can be sent either audited or un-audited and may be provided on a trade date or settlement date basis. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The AccountingStatementOfHoldings message is used to provide valuation detail for each financial instrument held in a portfolio. The message should be sent at a frequency agreed bi-laterally between the account servicer and the account owner. 
This message can only be used to list the holdings of a single (master) account. However, it is possible to break down these holdings into one or several sub-accounts. Therefore, the message can be used to either specify holdings at
 - the main account level, or,
 - the sub-account level. 
This message can be used to report where the financial instruments are safe-kept, physically or notionally. If a security is held in more than one safekeeping place, this can also be indicated. The AccountingStatementOfHoldings message should not be used for trading purposes. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Main characteristics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The AccountingStatementOfHoldings message has the following characteristics. This message is very similar in structure to the CustodyStatementOfHoldings message. 
Key differences between the two messages are: 
&lt;u&gt;Audited or non-audited statements&lt;/u&gt; 
It is mandatory to specify whether or not the statement is audited. This is done using the AuditedIndicator in the block StatementGeneralDetails. This indicator is not present in the CustodyStatementOfHolding message. 
&lt;u&gt;Price Details&lt;/u&gt; 
In the AccountingStatementOfHoldings message it is mandatory to price all securities. If the price of a security is not known, then this must also be reported. 
&lt;u&gt;Availability of Securities&lt;/u&gt; 
This message does not report on the availability of securities. The CustodyStatementOfHoldings message is used for this purpose.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Subscription order v03</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scope&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
An instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, sends the SubscriptionOrder message to the executing Party, eg, a transfer agent, to instruct the subscription of one or more financial instruments for one investment fund account. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The SubscriptionOrder message is used to instruct single subscription orders, ie, a message containing one order for one financial instrument and related to one investment account. The SubscriptionOrder message may also be used for multiple orders, ie, a message containing several orders related to the same investment account for different financial instruments. For a single subscription order, the SubscriptionOrder message, not the SubscriptionBulkOrder message, must be used. If there are subscription orders for the same financial instrument but for different accounts, then the SubscriptionBulkOrder message must be used. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Main characteristics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The SubscriptionOrder message has the following main characteristics: 
&lt;b&gt;Multiple Order Details&lt;/b&gt; 
An order is composed of one or several individual orders. These individual orders have common characteristics such as the same investment account, the same cancellation right and the same place of trade. However, each individual order may specify a different financial instrument, quantity of financial instrument, commission levels, etc. 
&lt;b&gt;Subscription in GrossAmount or NetAmount or UnitsNumber&lt;/b&gt; 
The subscription quantity must be expressed in one of the following ways: 
- GrossAmount: the monetary GROSS value of the financial instrument to be subscribed to, eg, the subscription of EUR 1,500 of financial instrument ISIN LU0123456789, or 
- NetAmount: the monetary NET value of the financial instrument to be subscribed to, eg, the subscription of EUR 1,000 of financial instrument ISIN LU0123456789, or 
- UnitNumber: the number of units of financial instrument to be subscribed to, eg, the subscription of 10 units of financial instrument ISIN LU0123456789. 
&lt;b&gt;Cash Settlement&lt;/b&gt; 
The cash settlement of a multiple order may be specified either as a single bulk payment, or as individual settlements for each order. Since the valuation and settlement cycle of all the investment funds in the multiple order may be different, there is no guarantee that a single bulk cash settlement may take place for all of the individual orders inside the multiple order. When a bulk cash settlement is not possible, specific cash settlement details may be included for each individual order inside a multiple order. If no standing instruction has been set up at the account level, then cash settlement information must be present in the message. If there is a standing instruction, but cash settlement information is also present in the message, then the cash settlement information in the message overrides the standing instruction. 
&lt;b&gt;Charge and Commission&lt;/b&gt; 
Generally speaking, a charge is directly paid by the investor whereas a commission is paid by the fund to the intermediary. This rule might not apply to some specific markets.</rdfs:comment>

The FundEstimatedCashForecastReport contains incoming and outgoing cash flows that are estimated, ie, the price has not been applied. If the price is definitive, then the FundConfirmedCashForecastReport message must be used. 
This message allows the report provider to report estimated cash movements in or out of a fund, but does not allow the Sender to categorise these movements, for example by country, or to give details of the underlying orders, commission or charges. 
If the report provider wishes to give detailed information related to estimated cash movements, then the FundDetailedEstimatedCashForecastReport message must be used.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
An instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, sends the OrderConfirmationStatusReport message to the executing party, eg, a transfer agent, to report the status of an order confirmation or an order confirmation amendment. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The OrderConfirmationStatusReport message is used to report on the status of one or more individual: 
- subscription confirmations, 
- subscription confirmation amendments, 
- redemption confirmations, 
- redemption confirmation amendments, 
- switch order confirmations, 
- switch order confirmation amendments. 
One of the following statuses can be reported: 
- confirmation rejected, or, 
- amendment rejected, or, 
- sent to next party, or, 
- communication problem with next party, or, 
- confirmation accepted, or, 
- confirmation received. 
It is likely that the OrderConfirmationStatusReport is only sent by the order instructing party to the order executing party to reject an order confirmation or to reject an order confirmation amendment, although if an intermediary party is used, the statuses sent to next party and communication problem with next party are also likely be used. The statuses confirmation accepted and confirmation received would only be used in the event the order executing party sends a RequestForOrderConfirmationStatusReport message and one of the other statuses does not apply. If the status being reported is either confirmation rejected or amendment rejected, then a reason for the rejection must be given. The individual order confirmation or confirmation amendment for which the status is given is identified with its order reference. The message identification of the message in which the individual order confirmation or confirmation amendment was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference, but this is not recommended.</rdfs:comment>

An executing party, eg, a transfer agent, sends the RedemptionBulkOrderConfirmation message to the instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative to confirm the details of execution for a previously received RedemptionBulkOrder message. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The RedemptionBulkOrderConfirmation message is used to confirm the execution of all individual orders included in a previously sent RedemptionBulkOrder message. There is usually one bulk confirmation message for one bulk order message. Each individual order confirmation specified is identified in DealReference. The reference of the original individual order is specified in OrderReference. The message identification of the RedemptionBulkOrder message in which the individual order was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference, but this is not recommended. A RedemptionBulkOrder must in all cases be responded to by a RedemptionBulkOrderConfirmation and in no circumstances by a RedemptionOrderConfirmation.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
An instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, sends the SwitchOrder message to the executing party, eg, a transfer agent, to instruct a switch transaction from a financial instrument or multiple financial instruments to a different specified financial instrument or instruments for a specified amount/quantity. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The SwitchOrder message is used to either: 
- instruct one switch transaction comprising one or more redemption legs and one or more subscription legs, ie, a single switch transaction that can be a one to one, many to one, many to many or one to many switch transaction, or, 
- instruct one or many switch transactions each comprising one redemption leg and one subscription leg, ie, multiple simple switch transactions. 
The SwitchOrder message may be used to either: 
- instruct a switch transaction for one investment account, or, 
- instruct a switch transaction for separate accounts at the redemption and subscription leg levels. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Main characteristics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The SwitchOrder message has the following main characteristics: 
&lt;b&gt;Complex Switch&lt;/b&gt; 
The message may cater for a switch from one financial instrument to another financial instrument (within the same fund family), many to one, many to many and one to many. 
&lt;b&gt;Cash-in or Cash-out&lt;/b&gt; 
The switch message caters for switch transactions that result in an additional cash payment from the investor or a transaction that results in a net payment to the investor. Not all institutions or funds permit this type of switch and acceptance is therefore not automatic. 
&lt;b&gt;Limitations on Switch Legs and Accounts&lt;/b&gt; 
There is no limitation on the number of switch legs in a switch message. The number allowed is defined by the fund prospectus or by the service level agreement (SLA) in place between the two parties. However, if the SwitchOrderDetails sequence is present more than once, then the RedemptionLegDetails and SubscriptionLegDetails sequences may only be present once. If SwitchOrderDetails\InvestmentAccount is used, then the InvestmentAccountDetails sequences in SubscriptionLegDetails and RedemptionLegDetails are not allowed. This functionality is to be used by institutions that set up two accounts per investor, rather than one investment account. 
&lt;b&gt;Switch Driver Type&lt;/b&gt; 
There is no switch driver type in the message to indicate whether the switch is buy or sell driven. A driver is not needed since it is possible to indicate the total subscription amount or the total redemption amount. 
Only one of these two amounts should be used. 
&lt;b&gt;Subscription in Amount, Unit or Percentage&lt;/b&gt; 
The subscription quantity can be expressed in one of the following ways: 
- Amount: the monetary value (either GROSS or NET) of the financial instrument to be subscribed to, eg, the subscription of EUR 1,000 of financial instrument ISIN LU1234567890 or 
- Unit: the number of units of the financial instrument to be subscribed to, eg, the subscription of 10 units of financial instrument ISIN LU1234567890 or 
- Percentage of the total redemption amount: when the switch transaction is redemption driven, it is the part of the redemption amount that must be switched to a specific financial instrument, eg, the subscription quantity of financial instrument ISIN LU1234567890 represents 50% of the redemption amount of the financial instrument ISIN LU4444444444. 
&lt;b&gt;Redemption in Amount, Unit, Rate or Percentage&lt;/b&gt; 
The redemption quantity can be expressed in one of the following ways: 
- Amount: the monetary value (either GROSS or NET) of the financial instrument to be redeemed, eg, the redemption of EUR 1,000 of financial instrument ISIN LU1234567890, or 
- Unit: the number of units of financial instrument to be redeemed, eg, the redemption of 10 units of financial instrument ISIN LU1234567890, or 
- Rate: the part of the portfolio to be redeemed, eg, the redemption of 10% of the holdings in financial instrument ISIN LU1234567890, or 
- Percentage of the total subscription amount: when the switch transaction is subscription driven, it is the part of the subscription amount that must be the result of the redemption of a specific financial instrument, eg, the redemption quantity in financial instrument ABC represents 50% of the subscription amount of the financial instrument ISIN LU4444444444.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scope&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
An account servicer, eg, a transfer agent sends the CustodyStatementOfHoldings message to an account owner, eg, a fund manager or an account owner's designated agent to provide detailed holdings of the portfolio at a specified moment in time. The message provides, at a moment in time, the quantity and identification of the financial instruments that the account servicer holds for the account owner. The message can also include availability and the location of holdings to facilitate trading and minimise settlement issues. The message reports all information per financial instrument, ie, when a financial instrument is held at multiple places of safekeeping, the total holdings for all locations can be provided. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The CustodyStatementOfHoldings message is used to provide detailed quantity and availability information for financial instrument holdings of a portfolio. 
The message should be sent at a frequency agreed bi-laterally between the account servicer and the account owner. This message can be also be used to report where the financial instruments are safe-kept, physically or notionally. If a security is held in more than one safekeeping place, this can also be indicated. This message can reflect 
all outstanding holding information or may only contain changes since the previously sent statement. The CustodyStatementOfHoldings message can only be used to list the holdings of a single (master) account. However, it is possible to break down these holdings into one or several sub-accounts. 
Therefore, this message can be used to either specify holdings at
 - the main account level, or,
 - the sub-account level.</rdfs:comment>

An instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, sends the SubscriptionBulkOrderCancellationRequest message to the executing party, eg, a transfer agent, to request the cancellation of a previously sent SubscriptionBulkOrder instruction. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The SubscriptionBulkOrderCancellationRequest message is used to either: 
- request the cancellation of an entire SubscriptionBulkOrder message, ie, all the individual orders that it contained, or, 
- request the cancellation of one or more individual orders. 
There is no amendment, but a cancellation and re-instruct policy. 
There are two ways to use the message: 
(1) When the SubscriptionBulkOrderCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of an entire SubscriptionBulkOrder message, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the order references of all the individual orders listed in the SubscriptionBulkOrder message, or, 
- quoting the details of all the individual orders (this includes the OrderReference) listed in SubscriptionBulkOrder message, but this is not recommended. 
The message identification of the SubscriptionBulkOrder message may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to request the cancellation of an entire SubscriptionBulkOrder message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference, but this is not recommended. 
(2) When the SubscriptionBulkOrderCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of one or more individual orders, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the OrderReference of each individual order listed in the SubscriptionBulkOrder message, or, 
- quoting the details of each individual order (including the OrderReference) listed in SubscriptionBulkOrder message, but this is not recommended. The message identification of the SubscriptionBulkOrder message in which the individual order was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. The deadline and acceptance of a cancellation request is subject to a service level agreement (SLA). This cancellation message is a cancellation request. There is no automatic acceptance of the cancellation. The rejection or acceptance of an SubscriptionBulkOrderCancellationRequest is made using an OrderCancellationStatusReport message.</rdfs:comment>

&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The SwitchOrderConfirmationAmendment message is used to amend a previously sent switch order confirmation. Each order confirmation amendment specified is identified in DealReference. The reference of the original order is specified in OrderReference. The message identification of the SwitchOrder message in which the switch order was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference. The message identification of the SwitchOrderConfirmation message in which the original switch order confirmation was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scope&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
An instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative sends the RedemptionBulkOrder message to the executing party, eg, a transfer agent, to instruct a redemption from a financial instrument for two or more accounts. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The RedemptionBulkOrder message is used to bulk several individual orders into one bulk order. The individual orders come from different instructing parties, ie, account owners, but are for the same financial instrument. 
The RedemptionBulkOrder can result in one single bulk cash settlement or several individual cash settlements. This message will be typically used by a party collecting orders, ie, a concentrator, bulking these individual orders into one bulk order before sending it to an executing party. 
For a single redemption order, the RedemptionOrder message, not the RedemptionBulkOrder message, must be used. If there are redemption orders for different financial instruments but for the same account, then the RedemptionOrder must be used. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Main characteristics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The RedemptionBulkOrder message has the following main characteristics: 
&lt;b&gt;Bulk Order&lt;/b&gt; 
A bulk order is composed of several individual orders. These individual orders have common characteristics. They are for the same financial instrument, have the same cancellation rights, the same place of trade, the same requested net asset value (NAV) currency and the same requested settlement currency. 
However, each individual order can specify a different investment fund account, different quantities of financial instrument, different commission levels, etc. Except for these constraints, there are no specific guidelines on how to bulk individual orders. 
&lt;b&gt;Redemption in GrossAmount or NetAmount or UnitsNumber or HoldingsRedemptionRate&lt;/b&gt; 
The redemption quantity must be expressed in one of the following ways: 
- GrossAmount: the monetary GROSS value of the financial instrument to be redeemed to, eg, the redemption of EUR 1,500 of financial instrument ISIN LU0123456789, or 
- NetAmount: the monetary NET value of the financial instrument to be redeemed to, eg, the redemption of EUR 1,000 of financial instrument ISIN LU0123456789, or 
- UnitNumber: the number of units of financial instrument to be redeemed to, eg, the redemption of 10 units of financial instrument ISIN LU0123456789. 
- HoldingsRedemptionRate: the part of the portfolio to be redeemed, eg, the redemption of 10% of the holdings in financial instrument ISIN LU1234567890. 
&lt;b&gt;Cash Settlement&lt;/b&gt; 
The cash settlement of a bulk order may be specified in one of the two ways, either as a single bulk payment, or individual settlements for each order. 
There might be a standing instruction in place and therefore no need to repeat the cash settlement information in the order. If no standing instruction has been set up at the account level, then cash settlement information must be present in the message. If there is a standing instruction, but cash settlement information is also present in the message, then the cash settlement information in the message overrides the standing instruction. Message Definition Report Edition May 2008 MX setr.001.001.03 RedemptionBulkOrderV03 Investment Funds 2 / Maintenance Page 1332 
&lt;b&gt;Charge and Commission&lt;/b&gt; 
Generally speaking, a charge is directly paid by the investor whereas a commission is paid by the fund to the intermediary. This rule might not apply to some specific markets.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
An executing party, eg, a transfer agent, sends the SwitchOrderConfirmation message to the instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative to confirm the details of the execution of a previously received SwitchOrder instruction. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The SwitchOrderConfirmation message is used to confirm that all the legs of the previously instructed switch order have been executed. The reference of the switch order confirmation is identified in DealReference. The reference of the original switch order is specified in OrderReference. The message identification of the SwitchOrder message in which the switch order was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference. If the SwitchOrderConfirmation Details sequence is present more than once, then the redemption leg details and subscription leg details sequences may only be present once. If Switch Confirmation Order Details\Investment Account is used, then the Investment Account Details sequences in Subscription Leg Details and Redemption Leg Details are not allowed. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Limitations on Switch Legs and Accounts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
If the SwitchOrderConfirmation Details sequence is present more than once, then the redemption leg details and subscription leg details sequences may only be present once. If SwitchOrderConfirmationDetails\InvestmentAccount is used, then the InvestmentAccountDetails sequences in SubscriptionLegDetails and RedemptionLegDetails are not allowed. This functionality is to be used by institutions that set up two accounts per investor, rather than one investment account.</rdfs:comment>

An account servicer, eg, a transfer agent sends the StatementOfInvestmentFundTransactions message to an account owner, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative to provide detailed transactions (increases and decreases) of holdings which occurred during a specified period of time. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The StatementOfInvestmentFundTransactions message is used to list the holdings transactions of a single (master) account or several sub-accounts. This message should be used at a frequency agreed bi-laterally between the account servicer and the account owner. 
This message must not be used in place of confirmation messages.</rdfs:comment>

An account owner, eg, and investor or its designated agent, sends the AccountModificationInstruction message to an account servicer, eg, a registrar, transfer agent or custodian bank to modify, ie, create, update or delete specific details of an existing investment fund account. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The AccountModificationInstruction message is used to modify the details of an existing account. 
The AccountModificationInstruction message has three specific uses:
 - to maintain/update any of the existing account details, eg, to update the address of the beneficiary or modify the preference to income from distribution to capitalisation, or,
 - to add/create specific details to the existing account when these details were not yet recorded at the time of account creation, eg, to add a second address or to establish new cash settlement standing instructions, or,
 - to delete specific account details, eg, delete cash standing instructions. This message cannot be used to delete an entire account, as institution specific and regulatory rules pertaining to account deletion are diverse. 
The usage of this message may be subject to service level agreement (SLA) between the counterparties. Execution of the AccountModificationInstruction is confirmed via an AccountDetailsConfirmation message.</rdfs:comment>

An instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, sends the RedemptionBulkOrderCancellationRequest message to the executing party, eg, a transfer agent, to request the cancellation of a previously sent RedemptionBulkOrder instruction. &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The RedemptionBulkOrderCancellationRequest message is used to either: 
- request the cancellation of an entire RedemptionBulkOrder message, ie, all the individual orders that it contained, or, 
- request the cancellation of one or more individual orders included in a previously sent RedemptionBulkOrder message. There is no amendment, but a cancellation and re-instruct policy. There are two ways to use the message. 
(1) When the RedemptionBulkOrderCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of an entire RedemptionBulkOrder message, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the order references of all the individual orders listed in the RedemptionBulkOrder message, or, 
- quoting the details of all the individual orders (this includes the OrderReference) listed in RedemptionBulkOrder message, but this is not recommended. The message identification of the RedemptionBulkOrder message may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to request the cancellation of an entire RedemptionBulkOrder message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference, but this is not recommended. 
(2) When the RedemptionBulkOrderCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of one or more individual orders, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the OrderReference of each individual order listed in the RedemptionOrder message, or, - quoting the details of each individual order (including the OrderReference) listed in RedemptionOrder message, but this is not recommended. The message identification of the RedemptionBulkOrder message in which the individual order was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. The deadline and acceptance of a cancellation request is subject to a service level agreement (SLA). This cancellation message is a cancellation request. There is no automatic acceptance of the cancellation.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scope&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
An instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative sends the SubscriptionBulkOrder message to the executing party, eg, a transfer agent, to instruct a subscription to a financial instrument for two or more accounts. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The SubscriptionBulkOrder message is used to bulk several individual orders into one bulk order. The individual orders come from different instructing parties, ie, account owners, but are related to the same financial instrument. 
This message will typically be used by a party collecting orders and bulking these individual orders into one bulk order before sending it to another party. For a single subscription order, the SubscriptionOrder message, not the SubscriptionBulkOrder message, must be used. If there are subscription orders for different financial instruments but for the same account, then the SubscriptionOrder must be used. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Main characteristics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The SubscriptionBulkOrder message has the following main characteristics: 
&lt;b&gt;Bulk Order &lt;/b&gt;
A bulk order is composed of several individual orders. These individual orders have common characteristics. They are for the same financial instrument, have the same cancellation rights, the same place of trade, the same requested net asset value (NAV) currency and the same requested settlement currency. However, each individual order can specify a different investment fund account, different quantities of financial instrument, different commission levels, etc. Except for these&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;constraints, there are no specific guidelines on how to bulk individual orders.
&lt;b&gt;Subscription in GrossAmount or NetAmount or UnitsNumber&lt;/b&gt;
The subscription quantity must be expressed in one of the following ways:
- GrossAmount: the monetary GROSS value of the financial instrument to be subscribed to, eg, the subscription of EUR 1,500 of financial instrument ISIN LU0123456789, or
- NetAmount: the monetary NET value of the financial instrument to be subscribed to, eg, the subscription of EUR 1,000 of financial instrument ISIN LU0123456789, or
- UnitNumber: the number of units of financial instrument to be subscribed to, eg, the subscription of 10 units of financial instrument ISIN LU0123456789.
&lt;b&gt;Cash Settlement&lt;/b&gt;
The cash settlement of a bulk order may be specified in one of the two ways, either as a single bulk payment, or individual settlements for each order. There might be a standing instruction in place and therefore no need to repeat the cash settlement information in the order.
If no standing instruction has been set up at the account level, then cash settlement information must be present in the message. If there is a standing instruction, but cash settlement information is also present in the message, then the cash settlement information in the message overrides the standing instruction.
&lt;b&gt;Charge and Commission&lt;/b&gt;
Generally speaking, a charge is directly paid by the investor whereas a commission is paid by the fund to the intermediary.
This rule might not apply to some specific markets.</rdfs:comment>

An account servicer, eg, a registrar, transfer agent or custodian bank sends the AccountDetailsConfirmation message to an account owner, eg, an investor to confirm the opening of an investment fund account, execution of an AccountModificationInstruction or to return information requested in a GetAccountDetails message. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The AccountDetailsConfirmation message is used to confirm the opening of an account, modification of an account or the provision of information requested in a previously sent GetAccountDetails message. The message contains detailed information relevant to the opened account. When the AccountDetailsConfirmation is used to confirm execution of an AccountModificationInstruction message, it contains the modified subsets of account details that were specified in the AccountModificationInstruction. When the AccountDetailsConfirmation is used to reply to a GetAccountDetails message, it returns the selected subsets of account details that were specified in the GetAccountDetails message.</rdfs:comment>

An executing party, eg, a transfer agent, sends the ReversalOfTransferInConfirmation message to the instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, to cancel a previously sent TransferInConfirmation message. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The ReversalOfTransferInConfirmation message is used to reverse a previously sent TransferInConfirmation. There are two ways to specify the reversal of the transfer in confirmation. Either:
 - the business references, eg, TransferReference, TransferConfirmationIdentification, of the transfer confirmation are quoted, or,
 - all the details of the transfer confirmation (this includes TransferReference and TransferConfirmationIdentification) are quoted but this is not recommended. 
The message identification of the TransferInConfirmation message in which the transfer confirmation was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. The message reference (MessageIdentification) of the TransferInInstruction message in which the transfer instruction was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference. 
It is also possible to request a reversal of a TransferInConfirmation by quoting its message reference (MessageIdentification) in PreviousReference.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
An executing party, eg, a transfer agent, sends the OrderInstructionStatusReport to the instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative to report the status of an order from the time the executing party receives the order until the time the order is executed. Usage The OrderInstructionStatusReport message is used to report on the status of a subscription, redemption or a switch order. 
The OrderInstructionStatusReport message may be used to give the status of: 
- one order message by using OrderDetailsReport or, 
- one or more individual order instructions by using IndividualOrderDetailsReport, or 
- one or more switch orders by using SwitchOrderDetailsReport. If the OrderInstructionStatusReport message is used to report the status of an individual order, then IndividualOrderDetailsReport is used and the order reference of the individual order is quoted in OrderReference. The message identification of the message in which the individual order was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference. If the OrderInstructionStatusReport message is used to report the status of a switch order, then SwitchOrderDetailsReport is used and the order reference of the switch order is quoted in OrderReference. The message identification of the message in which the switch order was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference. If the OrderInstructionStatusReport message is used to report the status of an entire order message, for example, the SubscriptionBulkOrder, or a SubscriptionOrder containing several orders, then OrderDetailsReport is used and the message identification of the order message is quoted in RelatedReference. All the orders within the message must have the same status. One of the following statuses can be reported: 
- an accepted status , or, 
- an already executed status, or, 
- a sent to next party status, or, 
- a received status, or, 
- a settled status, or, 
- a communication problem with next party status, or, 
- a confirmation amendment status, or, 
- a done for the day status, or,
 - a partially done status, or, 
- an open status, or, 
- a cancelled status, or 
- a conditionally accepted status, or, 
- a rejected status, or, 
- a suspended status, or, 
- a partially settled status, or, 
- an in-repair status (only for an individual or switch order). 
For a switch order, the OrderInstructionStatusReport message provides the status of the whole switch order, ie, it is not possible to accept one leg and to reject the other leg: the entire switch order has to be rejected. In order to identify the legs within the switch that are causing the problem, the leg is identified in either the RedemptionLegIdentification or SubscriptionLegIdentification elements. When the OrderInstructionStatusReport is used to give the status of an individual or a switch order, the following can be specified: 
- repaired conditions (for a switch, this is at the level of a leg), 
- information related to the order, eg, settlement amount, number of units, expected trade date, etc. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Main characteristics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The OrderInstructionStatusReport message has the following characteristics: 
&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt; 
It is mandatory to include the reference of the previously sent order instruction for which the Sender is requesting a status. The message for which the status is provided is identified through referencing rather than by including a complete copy of the original order. 
&lt;b&gt;Pre-confirmation&lt;/b&gt; 
It is possible to provide an expected trade date and an expected settlement date in the OrderInstructionStatusReport. These pre-confirmation dates are elements that were not in the original order instruction but that enrich the instructing party's order. This information enables the instructing party the opportunity to complete the instruction prior to its execution rather than being informed in the confirmation message sent after execution. 
&lt;b&gt;Offering a repair service&lt;/b&gt; The executing party may offer a repair service to the instructing party. This is restricted to commission and charge details as they are the most common elements repaired. For example, if an instructing party is entitled to a reduced commission rate of two percent waiving, but the order contains zero percent, the executing party could provide an order status in which it informs the instructing party of the repaired commission rate. This operation still allows the instructing party to potentially cancel  the order before execution.</rdfs:comment>

    >An order message is typically a message containing a single order or multiple orders (list of orders related to several financial instruments) for the same account. It is a 'shopping list' for one account. This type of order is typically sent by financial advisers or banks that are managing a portfolio for a particular account.</rdfs:comment>

An executing party, eg, a transfer agent sends the SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmation message to the instructing party, eg, an  investment manager or its authorised representative to confirm the details of the execution of a SubscriptionBulkOrder instruction. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmation message is used to confirm the execution of all individual orders. There is usually one bulk confirmation message for one bulk order message. Each individual order confirmation specified is identified in DealReference. The reference of the original individual order is specified in OrderReference. 
The message identification of the SubscriptionBulkOrder message in which the individual order was conveyed may also be quoted in RelatedReference. A SubscriptionBulkOrder must in all cases be responded to by a SubscriptionBulkOrderConfirmation and in no circumstances by a SubscriptionOrderConfirmation. If the executing party needs to confirm a SubscriptionOrder instruction, then the SubscriptionOrderConfirmation must be used.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scope&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
An executing party, eg, a transfer agent, sends the SubscriptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message to the instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative to cancel a previously sent SubscriptionOrderConfirmation. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
The SubscriptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to cancel one or more previously sent subscription order confirmations. The amendment indicator element is used to specify whether the subscription order confirmation cancellation is to be followed by a SubscriptionOrderConfirmationAmendment. 
The SubscriptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to either: 
- cancel an entire SubscriptionOrderConfirmation message, ie, all the individual order confirmations that it contained, or, 
- request the cancellation of one or more individual confirmations. 
There are two ways to use the message. 
(1) When the SubscriptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to cancel an entire message, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the business references, eg, OrderReference, Deal Reference, of all the individual order confirmations listed in the SubscriptionOrderConfirmation message, or, 
- quoting the details of all the individual order confirmations (this includes the OrderReference and DealReference) listed in SubscriptionOrderConfirmation message but this is not recommended. The message identification of the SubscriptionOrderConfirmation message may also be quoted in PreviousReference. 
It is also possible to instruct the cancellation of an entire confirmation message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference. 
(2) When the SubscriptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to cancel one or more individual order confirmations, this can be done by either: 
- quoting the &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; references, eg, OrderReference, Deal Reference, of each individual order confirmation listed in the SubscriptionOrderConfirmation message, or, 
- quoting the details of each individual order execution (this includes the OrderReference and DealReference) listed in SubscriptionOrderConfirmation message but this is not recommended. The message identification of the SubscriptionOrderConfirmation message in which the individual order confirmation was conveyed may also be quoted in PreviousReference. 
The rejection or acceptance of a SubscriptionOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction is made using an OrderConfirmationStatusReport message.</rdfs:comment>

An instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative, sends the SwitchOrderCancellationRequest message to the executing party, eg, a transfer agent, to request the cancellation of a previously sent SwitchOrder instruction. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The SwitchOrderCancellationRequest is used to cancel the entire previously sent SwitchOrder instruction and all the individual legs that it contains. 
There is no amendment, but a cancellation and re-instruct policy. there are two ways to specify the switch cancellation. Either: 
- the order reference of the original switch order is quoted, or, 
- all the details of the original switch order (this includes the OrderReference) are quoted, but this is not recommended. 
The message identification of the SwitchOrder message may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to request the cancellation of a SwitchOrder message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference, but this is not recommended. The deadline and acceptance of a cancellation request is subject to a service level agreement (SLA). This cancellation message is a cancellation request. 
There is no automatic acceptance of the cancellation request. The rejection or acceptance of a SwitchOrderCancellationRequest is made using an OrderCancellationStatusReport message.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The RequestForOrderStatusReport message definition covers the message flow between an instructing party and an executing party. This message requests the status of an order message or an order cancellation instruction message.
The OrderInstructionStatusReport message definition covers the message flow between an executing party and an instructing party. This message informs the instructing party of the status of its order message, ie, SubscriptionOrder, SubscriptionBulkOrder, RedemptionOrder, RedemptionBulkOrder or SwitchOrder.
The OrderCancellationStatusReport message definition covers the message flow between an executing party and an instructing party. This message informs the instructing party of the status of its order cancellation request message, ie, SubscriptionOrderCancellationRequest, SubscriptionBulkOrderCancellationRequest, RedemptionOrderCancellationRequest, RedemptionBulkOrderCancellationRequest or SwitchOrderCancellationRequest. 

Two new message definitions are now available: the RequestForOrderConfirmationStatusReport and the OrderConfirmationStatusReport. 
They cover cases where the status of a confirmation needs to be communicated by the instructing party to the executing party (ie, the requesting party).</rdfs:comment>

An executing party, eg, a transfer agent, sends the SwitchOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message to the instructing party, eg, an investment manager or its authorised representative to amend a previously sent SwitchOrderConfirmation message. 
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 
The SwitchOrderConfirmationCancellationInstruction message is used to cancel a previously sent SwitchOrderConfirmation. The amendment indicator element is used to specify whether the switch order confirmation cancellation is to be followed by a switch order confirmation amendment. 
There are two ways to specify the switch order confirmation cancellation. 
Either: 
- the business references, eg, OrderReference, DealReference, of the switch order confirmation are quoted, or, 
- all the details of the switch order confirmation (this includes the OrderReference and DealReference) are quoted, but this is not recommended. 
The message identification of the SwitchOrderConfirmation message may also be quoted in PreviousReference. It is also possible to instruct the cancellation of the confirmation message by quoting its message identification in PreviousReference, but this is not recommended.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scope&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
An instructing party, eg, a (new) plan manager, sends the PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction message to the executing party, eg, a (old) plan manager, on behalf of the initiating party, eg, an investor (client), to instruct the transfer of financial instruments from the clients account at the old plan manager to the clients account at the new plan manager through a nominee account. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
The PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction message is used to instruct the withdrawal of one or more PEP or ISA or portfolio products from one account and deliver them to another account. The PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction message is used to instruct one or more transfers for one client. Each transfer is for delivery to the same account. The account may be owned by one or more individual investors or one or more corporate investors. Each transfer is identified in TransferIdentification. 
If the instructing party does not have enough information to instruct the transfer, then it must first send a RequestForPEPOrISAOrPortfolioInformation message to the executing party in order to receive a PEPOrISAOrPortfolioInformation message. 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Main characteristics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Single client/multiple transfer instructions&lt;/u&gt;
Each PEPOrISAOrPortfolioTransferInstruction message specifies one or more transfers for one client. Each transfer is for delivery to the cash same account 
&lt;u&gt;Quantity of the product&lt;/u&gt;
In order to cater for full and partial transfers of holdings, this message allows the quantity to be specified in three mutually exclusive ways. 
1. Percentage transfer: A quantity of a financial instrument (PEP or ISA) may be expressed as percentage of the investor's total holding. 
2. Amount transfer: A quantity of a financial instrument (PEP or ISA) may be expressed as an amount of money. 
3. Year transfer: A quantity of a financial instrument (PEP or ISA) may be identified by the year in which the PEP or ISA was created. Additionally the PEP or ISA may be made up of one or more assets. When the assets are specified, they must be identified by an ISIN or a SEDOL and optionally as a name. 
&lt;u&gt;Identification of the client&lt;/u&gt;
The client is identified by its account number with the old plan manager, its name and address. Additional client identification information, such as date of birth and social security number, must also be included, if known.</rdfs:comment>
